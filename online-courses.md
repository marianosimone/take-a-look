# Online Courses

A short list of the few online (e.g. Coursers) that I've taken and actually finished and recommend

- [Presentation skills: Designing Presentation Slides](https://www.coursera.org/learn/slides) by Alexei Kapterev: Although the name just talks about "Slides", I think it's a great course on overall design for information presentation.
- [A brief history of humankind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfc2WtGuVPdmhYaQjd449k-YeY71fiaFp) by Yuval Noah Harari: The author of "Sapiens", "Homo Deus" and "21 lessons for the 21st century" takes you through an amazing overview of the history of humans and why we are where we are.
