## Lawrence Lessig - "We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim"

There is a corruption at the heart of American politics, caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens.

## Eli Pariser - "Beware online 'filter bubbles'"

As web companies strive to tailor their services (including news and search results) to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous unintended consequence: We get trapped in a "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.

## Juan Enriquez - "To Grow Energy"

Juan Enriquez habla sobre cómo se podría mejorar la eficiencia de las fuentes de energía si se dejara de aplicar el enfoque “fuerza bruta” y se pasara al enfoque sostenido por los procesos biológicos (haciendo un paralelismo con cómo la agricultura se vio más beneficiada – en cuanto a volumen producido/calidad/impacto ambiental con la bioingeniería que con la maquinaria pesada y las grandes extensiones cultivadas)

## Inés Sanguineti - "Arte y Transformación Social"

Puede ser difícil cambiar el mundo (sino imposible)… pero hay un pequeño mundo a nuestro alrededor, que podemos cambiar con pequeñas cosas. TED, en parte, se trata de eso. El mundo no va a cambiar porque alguien aprenda una cosa nueva a partir de esto… pero su mundo cercano puede recibir un impacto positivo, y eso ya hizo que valiera la pena.

Tom "Mojombo" Preston-Werner: "Optimizing for Happiness"
The way traditional businesses approach the management and organization of creative, intellectual workers is wrong. By throwing away everything that blocks productivity (meetings, deadlines, managers, titles, strict vacation policies, etc) and treating your employees as the responsible adults that they are, huge amounts of potential can be unlocked and employee happiness and retention can be at unprecedented highs. At GitHub we've embraced a philosophy that gets things done and strips away policy and procedure in favor of smart decision making and personal responsibility. Come see how we make it work and how you can reap the same benefits in your own company.

## Brian Goldman: "Doctors make mistakes. Can we talk about that?"

Every doctor makes mistakes. But, says physician Brian Goldman, medicine's culture of denial (and shame) keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistakes, or using them to learn and improve. Telling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.

## Kevlin Henney: Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers

Habits help you manage the complexity of code. You apply existing skill and knowledge automatically to the detail while focusing on the bigger picture. But because you acquire habits largely by imitation, and rarely question them, how do you know your habits are effective? Many of the habits that programmers have for naming, formatting, commenting and unit testing do not stand up as rational and practical on closer inspection.
This talk examines seven coding habits that are not as effective as programmers believe, and suggests alternatives.

## Ben Horowitz - "Culture and Revolution"

We know that culture is important. We even think we know what it is. But culture isn’t perks like dogs and snacks in the workplace — nor is it a defining personality, like, say, “googleyness”. Culture is the collective behavior of an organization… and whether or not you go about creating one, you’re going to get one anyway, argues a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz. “Unless you set it, it’ll just be what it is.”

## Rick Steves - "Travel as a political act"

"Have you noticed how riddled with fear our country is lately? We’ve never been more afraid. I’m concerned about that. Because when a society is afraid, people with a wrong motive can take advantage of that society and make them become something that they’re not. There’s a lot of fear right now in the United States of America and the most fearful Americans are the Americans that are buried deep in the middle of this country with no passports. This is a concern. Fear is for people who don’t get out much. The flipside of fear is understanding, and we gain understanding when we travel. I think it’s important for our very democracy… that we get out there, we travel, and we gain an empathy for the other 96% of humanity"
