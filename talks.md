## Rich Hickey - "The Value of Values" (keynote @ JaxConf 2012)

In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data. The broad subject of the talk makes it worth watching for almost anyone in the programming world, and was one of the highlights of the JaxConf lineup.

## Maciej Cegłowski - "The Internet With A Human Face" (@ Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany, May 20, 2014)

A narrative that explains how the Internet of liberation became the Internet of inhuman and total surveillance. Increasingly, I'm heartened by the people who understand that the right debate to have is "How do we make the Internet a better place for human habitation?" and not "Is the Internet good or bad for us?" I'm also heartened to see the growth of the view that aggregated personal data is a kind of immortal toxic waste and that the best way to prevent spills is to not collect it in the first place.

## Jim Weirich and Joe O'Brien - "Mock Dialog" (Ruby Hoedown 2008)

Sit in like a fly on the wall with a development team as they wrestle with the issues of testing and the use of mock objects. Three acts cover using mock objects to remove dependencies on external dependencies, explore the use of mocks to isolate the code under test from the rest of the system, and look at when mocking can be an indication of a poor design. This is not your standard presentation with slides, but a peek into the everyday life of a development team.

## Idan Gazit - "Sketching a better product" (PyCon 2012)

If writing is a means for organizing your thoughts, then sketching is a means for organizing your thoughts visually. Just as good writing requires drafts, good design requires sketches: low-investment, low-resolution braindumps. Learn how
