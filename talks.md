## Lawrence Lessig - "We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim"

There is a corruption at the heart of American politics, caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens. That's the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig. With rapid-fire visuals, he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way, and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond.

## Eli Pariser - "Beware online 'filter bubbles'"

As web companies strive to tailor their services (including news and search results) to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous unintended consequence: We get trapped in a "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.

## Dan Pink - "The Surprising Science Of Motivation"

## Juan Enriquez - "To Grow Energy"

Juan Enriquez habla sobre cómo se podría mejorar la eficiencia de las fuentes de energía si se dejara de aplicar el enfoque “fuerza bruta” y se pasara al enfoque sostenido por los procesos biológicos (haciendo un paralelismo con cómo la agricultura se vio más beneficiada – en cuanto a volumen producido/calidad/impacto ambiental con la bioingeniería que con la maquinaria pesada y las grandes extensiones cultivadas)

## Inés Sanguineti - "Arte y Transformación Social"

Puede ser difícil cambiar el mundo (sino imposible)… pero hay un pequeño mundo a nuestro alrededor, que podemos cambiar con pequeñas cosas. TED, en parte, se trata de eso. El mundo no va a cambiar porque alguien aprenda una cosa nueva a partir de esto… pero su mundo cercano puede recibir un impacto positivo, y eso ya hizo que valiera la pena.

Tom "Mojombo" Preston-Werner: "Optimizing for Happiness"
The way traditional businesses approach the management and organization of creative, intellectual workers is wrong. By throwing away everything that blocks productivity (meetings, deadlines, managers, titles, strict vacation policies, etc) and treating your employees as the responsible adults that they are, huge amounts of potential can be unlocked and employee happiness and retention can be at unprecedented highs. At GitHub we've embraced a philosophy that gets things done and strips away policy and procedure in favor of smart decision making and personal responsibility. Come see how we make it work and how you can reap the same benefits in your own company.

## Brian Goldman: "Doctors make mistakes. Can we talk about that?"

Every doctor makes mistakes. But, says physician Brian Goldman, medicine's culture of denial (and shame) keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistakes, or using them to learn and improve. Telling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.

## Kevlin Henney: Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers

Habits help you manage the complexity of code. You apply existing skill and knowledge automatically to the detail while focusing on the bigger picture. But because you acquire habits largely by imitation, and rarely question them, how do you know your habits are effective? Many of the habits that programmers have for naming, formatting, commenting and unit testing do not stand up as rational and practical on closer inspection.
This talk examines seven coding habits that are not as effective as programmers believe, and suggests alternatives.
