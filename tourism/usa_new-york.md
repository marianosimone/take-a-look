## Eat & Drink

- [Brooklyn Brewery](http://brooklynbrewery.com/) (Williamsburg, Brooklyn): Good beers (try the Winter or Summer ales) and good vibe. The DON'T serve food (you can bring your own from outside). It's worth paying them a visit on their Small Batch tours or at least the open tours on Sat-Sun.
