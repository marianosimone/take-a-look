# Bay Area (USA)

## Do
- [Musée Mécanique](http://www.museemecaniquesf.com) (Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco): An odd (and sometimes scary) collection of old and working of coin-operated mechanical musical instruments and antique arcade machines
- [Muir Woods National Monument](http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm): Beautiful (but sometimes crowded) redwood forest
- [	
Armstrong Redwoods State Park](http://www.russianrivertravel.com/parks-armstrong.htm): If you have some extra time, and are willing to drive for a couple of hours, this is a great alternative to Muir. There's a lot less infrastructure, but also less people.
- [Japanese Tea Garden](http://www.japaneseteagardensf.com) (Golden Gate Park, San Francisco): A nice (albeit a bit expensive) Japanese Garden and Tea House. The Buddha statue and the bridge are wonderful

## Eat & Drink
- [Barney's Gourmet Burgers](http://www.barneyshamburgers.com/) (San Francisco/Oakland/Berkeley)
- [Farm Burguer](http://www.farmburger.net/) (Berkeley/Marin)

### Beer

- [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/) (SoMa, San Francisco): Great beers AND food
