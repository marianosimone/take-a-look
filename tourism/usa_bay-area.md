# Bay Area (USA)

## Do

- [Japanese Tea Garden](http://www.japaneseteagardensf.com) (Golden Gate Park, San Francisco): A nice (albeit a bit expensive) Japanese Garden and Tea House. The Buddha statue and the bridge are wonderful

### Museums

- [Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/) One of the most amazing and well-designed nature-science-oriented Museums ever
- [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/) Particularly interesting for kids, but a VERY enjoyable option for everyone in a rainy/cold day
- [Musée Mécanique](http://www.museemecaniquesf.com) (Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco): An odd (and sometimes scary) collection of old and working of coin-operated mechanical musical instruments and antique arcade machines

### Hiking

- [	
Armstrong Redwoods State Park](http://www.russianrivertravel.com/parks-armstrong.htm): If you have some extra time, and are willing to drive for a couple of hours, this is a great alternative to Muir. There's a lot less infrastructure, but also less people.
- [Land's End Hiking Trails]: Awesome views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the other side, and the vast open sea.
- Lake Anza: A cool little lake with a beach (there's an entrance fee to the beach itself), and a lot of hiking trails around it. Also, getting up there gives you really cool views of the Bay.
- [Muir Woods National Monument](http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm): Beautiful (but sometimes crowded) redwood forest
