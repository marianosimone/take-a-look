# Bay Area (USA)

## Do

- [Japanese Tea Garden](http://www.japaneseteagardensf.com) (Golden Gate Park, San Francisco): A nice (albeit a bit expensive) Japanese Garden and Tea House. The Buddha statue and the bridge are wonderful
- Diego Rivera Murals: If you are into Diego Rivera, you are in for a treat, there are a couple of them in the Area, and easy to get to (search for instructions, as they change the opening times).
- [Saint John Coltrane Global Spiritual Community](http://www.coltranechurch.org): Yes, THE John Coltrane... You can attend mass on Sundays... and believe me, it goes from mass to an amazing jazz concert in a sec.
- [Berkeley Rose Garden](http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/contentdisplay.aspx?id=12048)

### Museums

- [Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/) One of the most amazing and well-designed nature-science-oriented Museums ever (don't miss the NightLife events on Thursday nights)
- [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/) Particularly interesting for kids, but a VERY enjoyable option for everyone in a rainy/cold day
- [Musée Mécanique](http://www.museemecaniquesf.com) (Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco): An odd (and sometimes scary) collection of old and working of coin-operated mechanical musical instruments and antique arcade machines

### Hiking

- [
Armstrong Redwoods State Park](http://www.russianrivertravel.com/parks-armstrong.htm): If you have some extra time, and are willing to drive for a couple of hours, this is a great alternative to Muir. There's a lot less infrastructure, but also less people.
- [Land's End Hiking Trails](https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/landsend.htm): Awesome views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the other side, and the vast open sea.
- [Tilden Park/Lake Anza](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden): A cool little lake with a beach (there's an entrance fee to the beach itself), and a lot of hiking trails around it. Also, getting up there gives you really cool views of the Bay.
- [Muir Woods National Monument](http://www.nps.gov/muwo/index.htm): Beautiful (but sometimes crowded) redwood forest
- [Crown Beach](https://www.ebparks.org/parks/crown_beach) (Alameda Island): More strolling than hiking, but a beautiful location nevertheless.
- [Tilden Regional Park](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden.htm) (Berkeley)

### Music

- [The Black Cat](http://www.blackcatsf.com/): Great live music (Jazz), good food and drinks.
- [Groupmuse](https://www.groupmuse.com): Groupmuse is a platform enabling communities to come together around great art; an online social network that connects young classical musicians to local audiences through concert house parties. Share the great masterpieces of music with old and new friends — in your living room and throughout your city.
