 content: "Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted; the indifference of those who should have known better; the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most; that has made it possible for evil to triumph.
 Today I stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor."

 content: A qualified man with vision, unmoved by daily selfish interests, will be led to right decisions by his conscience. In general, a man who knows from whence he comes and where he is going will co-operate with his fellow human beings. He will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties but will inspire others by his good example.

 content: Supposing that I say to you, that you are enlightened. And you responded, “Although I know this is the first step to enlightenment, I still struggle to get over the frustration I create when I can't shut off my mind or am thinking how I'm supposed to feel when meditating, etc. So, what must I do to feel it really?” and my answer is this, “You ask me that question because you don’t want to feel it really. You’re frightened of it.” And what you are going to do is you’re going to get a method of practice so you can put it off. So that I can say, “Well I can be a long time on the way getting this thing and then maybe I’ll be worthy of it after I have suffered enough”. See, because we are brought up in a social scheme whereby we have to deserve what we get. And the price that of all good one pays is suffering. But all of that is precisely postponement. Because one is afraid here and now to see it. If you had the nerve, real nerve, you would see it right away. Only one feels that you shouldn’t have nerve like that. “Why that would be awful. That wouldn’t do at all” because after all I’m supposed to be ‘poor little me’. And I’m not really much of a ‘muchness’. And I’m playing the role of being ‘poor little me’. And therefore in order to be something great, I ought to suffer for it. So you can suffer for it. There are all kinds of ways invented for you to do this. And you can discipline yourself and gain control of your mind and you can do all sorts of extraordinary things. You can drink water in through your rectum and do the most fantastic things. But that’s like being able to run the 100 yards in 9 seconds or push a peanut up a mountain with your nose or any other kind of accomplishment you want to engage in. It has absolutely nothing to do with the realization of the self. The realization of the self fundamentally depends on ‘coming off it’. You know the sort of people that put on some kind of an act and you’re like “Oh, come off it” and some people can come of it. They laugh and suddenly realize that they were making fools of themselves and they laugh at themselves and come off it.

 content: "[People] find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man’s intelligence…It is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease. They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.
But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realized by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it…Charity degrades and demoralizes…Charity creates a multitude of sins.
…It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.

There is not the condition of nothingness, neither is there the state of this world or another world, nor sun nor moon. This is the uncreated.
This condition I call neither arising nor passing away, neither dying nor being born. It is without form and without change. It is the eternal, which never originates and never passes away. To find it is the end of suffering."

  content: "We're deeply suspicious of the word 'consumerism'; it's become a stick with which to beat the modern world. Yet consumerism doesn’t have to be stupid. At its best, what the word refers to is a love of the fruits of the earth, a delight in human ingenuity and an appreciation of the vast achievements of organised labour and trade.
This picture takes us to an instructive time when abundance was new and not to be taken for granted. The picture knows it was hard to get that lobster. They were still amazed - as we should be - that the world can be controlled enough to have lobster in a lemon-butter dressing and pigeon pie; that you can get many varieties of cheese. They knew that marshes had to be drained and cattle fed through the winter; and they were impressed that lemons could reach a northern table: perhaps these very fruits were carried by donkey from the Neapolitan hills down to the harbour, onto leaky wooden ships that braved storms and struggled with unreliable winds. They knew how hard this all was, and how astonishing that human beings could do this. They felt the beauty of trade and understood how easily it could be disrupted by blockades or war. Every pleasure of the table was sending money around Europe - a force for peace and prosperity. The picture remembers all this effort, and celebrates it.
We are so afraid of greed that we forget how honourable the love of material things can be. In 1644 homage was still paid to the nobility of commerce; a concept that boredom and guilt make less accessible to us. Perhaps we can learn from this picture. A good response to consumerism mightn’t be to sacrifice these pleasures and live without lobster and lemons, but to appreciate what really needs to go into providing them. Our desire to have luxury cheaply is the real problem - to care only for the low price. If the route to your table were dignified and ethical at every stage, a lemon would of course cost more. But maybe then we’d stop taking lemons for granted and our appreciation of their zest would be all the keener."

- content: "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world’s greatest civilizations has been 200 years."

- content: I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.

I've spent a lot of time over the years desperately trying to think of a "thing" to change the world. I now know why the search was fruitless -- things don't change the world. People change the world by using things. The focus must be on the "using", not the "thing". Now that I'm looking through the right end of the binoculars, I can see a lot more clearly, and there are projects and possibilities that genuinely interest me deeply.

- content: Most things don't have to be perfect. In particular, things involving human interactions don't have to be perfect, because groups of humans have all these self-regulations built in. If you and I have an agreement and you screwed me over badly, you've always got in the back of your mind the nagging worry that I'm going to show up on your doorstep with a club and kill you. Because of that, people don't tend to screw each other too much, right? At least, they try not to. One danger, perhaps, of moving towards an algorithmically driven society is that the algorithms aren't scared of us showing up and beating them up. The algorithms will do whatever it is that they are designed to do.

Now, I tell you, these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes. If they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes, who here would lack them? It is not fitting for the noble disciple who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so. Instead, the noble disciple who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life. In so doing, he will attain long life, either human or divine. (Similarly with beauty, pleasure, status, and rebirth in heaven.)
