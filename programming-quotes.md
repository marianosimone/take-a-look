# The Developer Bill of Rights

As seen in Extreme Programming:

- You have the right to know what is needed, via clear requirements, with clear declarations of priority
- You have the right to say how long each requirement will take you to implement, and to revise estimates given experience
- You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned to you
- You have the right to produce quality work at all times
- You have the right to peace, fun, and productive and enjoyable work

> A practice has to be an activity or a mode of working, but with a special twist: repeated application. In the absence of repetition, we may have an interesting technique, but it is not a practice unless it is performed regularly (in the case of an activity) or enforced systematically (in the case of a mode of working)
Bertrand Meyer in "Agile! The Good, the Hype and the Ugly"

> When there are two possible solutions, favor the one that is simpler and based on concrete need rather than the more intricate one that boasts of generality

Kevlin Henney in "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know"

> "Big data" has this intoxicating effect. We start collecting it out of fear, but then it seduces us into thinking that it will give us power. In the end, it's just a mirror, reflecting whatever assumptions we approach it with. But collecting it drives this dynamic of relentless surveillance.

Maciej Cegłowski, "The Internet with a Human Face"

> Waste is anything that does not improve the quality of the product, does not reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to produce the product or does not provide real value to the customer

TJ Gokcen, "Kanban for developers"

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand

Martin Fowler

> A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof was to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools

Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)

> If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in

Dykstra

> Program designers have a tendency to think of the users as idiots who need to be controlled. They should rather think of their program as a servant, whose master, the user, should be able to control it.

John McCarthy

> I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits

Kent Beck

> A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant

Alan J. Perlis.

> Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter

Eric S. Raymond

> For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match

Bill Bryson

> Good design adds value faster than it adds cost

Thomas C. Gale

> Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight

Bill Gates

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it

Brian W. Kernighan

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code

Linus Torvalds

> Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program

Linus Torvalds

> Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix will be obvious to someone.

Linus Torvalds

> Doing good engineering is not primarily making good decisions, it's seeking good feedback which lets you quickly discard bad decisions

Kent Beck

> Don’t claim to have a config option, if you don’t actually have the UI to change it.

Linus Torvalds

> There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies

C.A.R. Hoare
