# The Developer Bill of Rights

As seen in Extreme Programming:

- You have the right to know what is needed, via clear requirements, with clear declarations of priority
- You have the right to say how long each requirement will take you to implement, and to revise estimates given experience
- You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned to you
- You have the right to produce quality work at all times
- You have the right to peace, fun, and productive and enjoyable work

> A practice has to be an activity or a mode of working, but with a special twist: repeated application. In the absence of repetition, we may have an interesting technique, but it is not a practice unless it is performed regularly (in the case of an activity) or enforced systematically (in the case of a mode of working)
Bertrand Meyer in "Agile! The Good, the Hype and the Ugly"

> When there are two possible solutions, favor the one that is simpler and based on concrete need rather than the more intricate one that boasts of generality

Kevlin Henney in "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know"

> "Big data" has this intoxicating effect. We start collecting it out of fear, but then it seduces us into thinking that it will give us power. In the end, it's just a mirror, reflecting whatever assumptions we approach it with. But collecting it drives this dynamic of relentless surveillance.

Maciej Ceg≈Çowski, "The Internet with a Human Face"
