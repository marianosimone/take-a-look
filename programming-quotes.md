# The Developer Bill of Rights

As seen in Extreme Programming:

- You have the right to know what is needed, via clear requirements, with clear declarations of priority
- You have the right to say how long each requirement will take you to implement, and to revise estimates given experience
- You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned to you
- You have the right to produce quality work at all times
- You have the right to peace, fun, and productive and enjoyable work

> A practice has to be an activity or a mode of working, but with a special twist: repeated application. In the absence of repetition, we may have an interesting technique, but it is not a practice unless it is performed regularly (in the case of an activity) or enforced systematically (in the case of a mode of working)
