## Rich Hickey - "The Value of Values" (keynote @ JaxConf 2012)

In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data. The broad subject of the talk makes it worth watching for almost anyone in the programming world, and was one of the highlights of the JaxConf lineup.

## Maciej Cegłowski - "The Internet With A Human Face" (@ Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany, May 20, 2014)

A narrative that explains how the Internet of liberation became the Internet of inhuman and total surveillance. Increasingly, I'm heartened by the people who understand that the right debate to have is "How do we make the Internet a better place for human habitation?" and not "Is the Internet good or bad for us?" I'm also heartened to see the growth of the view that aggregated personal data is a kind of immortal toxic waste and that the best way to prevent spills is to not collect it in the first place.

## TJ Gokcen - "Kanban for Developers"

There is much hype about Kanban since it was perfected and introduced to the world by Toyota. Since then, not only manufacturers but all businesses looked into this simple but extremely powerful approach.

## Jim Weirich and Joe O'Brien - "Mock Dialog" (Ruby Hoedown 2008)

Sit in like a fly on the wall with a development team as they wrestle with the issues of testing and the use of mock objects. Three acts cover using mock objects to remove dependencies on external dependencies, explore the use of mocks to isolate the code under test from the rest of the system, and look at when mocking can be an indication of a poor design. This is not your standard presentation with slides, but a peek into the everyday life of a development team.

## Josh Kaufman - "Shut Up and Take My Money: How to Find Business Ideas Customers Want" (MicroConf 2013)

A story on how to get to the ideal:

- Sit in front of customer
- tell them about your product
- get interrupted with “Shut up and take my money”

## Jack Diederich - "Stop Writing Classes" (PyCon 2012)

Classes are great but they are also overused. This talk will describe examples of class overuse taken from real world code and refactor the unnecessary classes, exceptions, and modules out of them.

## Idan Gazit - "Sketching a better product" (PyCon 2012)

If writing is a means for organizing your thoughts, then sketching is a means for organizing your thoughts visually. Just as good writing requires drafts, good design requires sketches: low-investment, low-resolution braindumps. Learn how

## Bret Victor - "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations"

Throughout the history of science, diagrams and graphs have been essential thinking tools. In the past, such visualizations were drawn with pen on paper, and could embrace the directness, freedom, and expressiveness of hand drawing. Most modern visualizations are programmed instead, where a single description can dynamically generate a unique picture for any dataset.
Today's tools offer the benefits of one or the other -- either directness or dynamics -- but not both. Photoshop and Illustrator allow direct-manipulation drawing of static pictures. D3, R, and Processing allow indirect-manipulation coding of dynamic pictures.
This talk presents a tool for drawing dynamic pictures -- creating data-driven visualizations, like D3, but via direct manipulation of the picture itself, like Illustrator.

## Bret Victor - "Inventing on Principle"

Bret Victor on the power and effectiveness of organizing your work around a guiding principle. Victor's principle is "creators need an immediate connection to what they create" and he shows some really cool ways he's exploring that idea.

## Bret Victor - "Learnable Programming"

Here's a trick question: How do we get people to understand programming?

## Bret Victor - "The Future of Programming"

Presented at Dropbox's DBX conference on July 9, 2013.

## Bret Victor - "Stop Drawing Dead Fish"

People are alive -- they behave and respond. Creations within the computer can also live, behave, and respond... if they are allowed to. The message of this talk is that computer-based art tools should embrace both forms of life -- artists behaving through real-time performance, and art behaving through real-time simulation. Everything we draw should be alive by default.

## Gary Bernhardt - "Fast Test, Slow Test"

Most unit tests aren't and their authors suffer for it. What is a unit test, really? How can writing them prevent classic testing problems? If you do write them, what trade-offs are you implicitly making?

## Raymond Hettinger - "The Art of Sublcassing"

All problems have simple, easy-to-understand, logical wrong answers. Subclassing in Python is no exception. Avoid the common pitfalls and learn everything you need to know about making effective use of inheritance in Python.

## David Cramer - "Practicing Continuous Deployment"

Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster, and more often.

## Martin Fowler - "Introduction to NoSQL" (GOTO Conferences)

Martin gives a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency. From this he outlines what kinds of circumstances you should consider using them, why they will not make relational databases obsolete, and the important consequence of polyglot persistence.

## Joshua Bloch - "How to Design A Good API and Why it Matters"

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw) & [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/guestbe92f4/how-to-design-a-good-a-p-i-and-why-it-matters-g-o-o-g-l-e)

## Greg Wilson - "What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It's True"

Many claims are made about how certain tools, technologies, and practices improve software development. But which claims are verifiable, and which are merely wishful thinking?

## Kevin Lacker - "How to Design Great APIs" (Parse Developer Day 2013)

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCdpTji8nxo) and [post](http://blog.parse.com/events/parse-developer-day-video-series-how-to-design-great-apis/)

## Jake Archibald - "Reusable Code, for good or for awesome!" (beyond tellerrand Düsseldorf 2011)

What sets reusable JavaScript apart from other JavaScript? How can we make our code developer-friendly, fast, robust & compatible?

The API is make-or-break when it comes to reusable code. It's the API that lets other developers use your application, if it's difficult to use then they won't get the most out of what you've written.

We'll analyse existing APIs, looking at where they fail and where they succeed, looking at what patterns they use and how users react to them.

By looking at the wins and fails in the real world, we can discover what makes code a pleasure to use and reuse.

## Bertnard Meyer - "Genericity Versus Inheritance" (Paper)

Genericity, as in Ada or ML, and inheritance, as in object-oriented languages, are two alternative techniques for ensuring better extendibility, reusability, and compatibility of software components. This article is a comparative analysis of these two methods. It studies their similarities and differences and assesses to what extent each may be simulated in a language offering only the other. It shows what features are needed to successfully combine the two approaches in an object-oriented language that also features strong type checking. The discussion introduces the principal aspects of the language EiffePM whose design, resulting in part from this study, includes multiple inheritance and a limited form of genericity under full static typing.

## Bertnard Meyer - "Principles of language design and evolution"

Search for it, it's awesome

## Jake Wharton - "Managing State with RxJava"

RxJava's use in building Android apps has grown rapidly! Combining and composing synchronous and asynchronous sources of data has become easy. That burden that remains is where to put the overall state of the application and how to handle its changes. This talk will be an exploration in how we can increase the confidence and determinism of our app state.

Because Rx isn't specific to Android, we'll look at state management approaches employed by other platforms and languages and whether or not they're appropriate to use. We will also look at how state management fits into application architectures such as MVP and MVVM.

## Eirk Rose - "Designing Poetic APIs" (PyCon 2014)

The language you speak determines the thoughts you can think. Thus, API designers (and that includes you, if you've ever coined a function) have a great duty, as language inventors, to expand the mental canvases of those who come after. We'll concretize that into 7 hallmarks of good APIs, pulling examples (and bloopers) from popular Python libraries.

## Mike Cohn - "Agile Estimation" (Bay XP, March 20, 2007 Meeting @ Google)

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb9Rzyi8b90)

## Miško Hevery - "How to Write Clean, Testable Code" (Google Tech Talks, 2010)

The Clean Code Talks are designed to help teams get better at writing clean, well-designed, testable code. Such code is easier to write tests for, more robust, easier to understand and maintain. Having clean code lets you be more productive. It helps you release more often, with more robustness, more confidence, and fewer rollbacks.

## Rich Hickey - "Spec-ulation"

A rant against semantic versioning, and how "change" is not a thing: you are either adding (thus not breaking a contract) or removing (thus breaking everything)

## Jennifer Tu - "Humans Aren't APIs And Your Request Is 400 Denied" (RubyConf 2018)

Have you ever asked someone to do something, and they hear the exact opposite?

Why do miscommunications happen? Does knowing why matter? And more importantly, how do you achieve your original desired request?

If you want to learn more ways to influence those around you, this talk is for you! You’ll learn about different causes for failed communications, and different workarounds you can apply for different failure modes. Come to this talk to add another tool to your communications toolbox.

## Jack Danger - "Designing an engineering team: Making room for everyone" (RubyConf 2018)

How many different roles are there on engineering teams? Officially, there's probably just a manager and maybe a tech lead. Unofficially, you have technical specialists, company veterans, people focused on tools, and those who think deeply about the product. In this talk we'll steal the best ideas from operating rooms, wartime deployments, and courtroom litigation. We'll see how it's possible to train, reward, and empower your teammates by respecting their uniqueness while also making room for very junior developers to join fast-moving teams.

## Jason Lengstorf - "Make the Right Thing the Easy Thing: Designing Processes Teams Will Actually Follow" (LeadDev NY 2018)

When we work alone, it’s easy to make sure things come out the way we think is best. But what happens when we need to get an entire team to agree on — and actually _use_ — best practices? What if we have to convince an entire _company_?

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqT8e6_yzLg)

## Runar Bjarnason - "Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain" (Scala World 2015)

As programmers, we tend to think of expressive power of a language or library as an unmitigated good. In this talk I want to show the contrary; that restraint and precision are usually better than power and flexibility. A constraint on component design leads to freedom and power when putting those components together into systems.

What’s more, this feature is built into the very nature of language and reasoning.

## Tanya Reilly - "Being Glue" (Lead Dev NY)

Your job title says "software engineer", but you seem to spend most of your time in meetings. You'd like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations: you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on your team?

Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be extremely career limiting. It pushes people into less technical roles and even out of the industry.

## Ben Weissmann - "Typing the Untyped: Soundness in Gradual Type Systems" (StrangeLoop 2019)

Recent years have seen an explosion of gradual type systems and superset languages that add types to previously untyped languages: TypeScript & Flow for Javascript, MyPy and Pyre for Python, Hack and PHP7 for PHP, Sorbet for Ruby, and many more. Implementing these type systems involves making tradeoffs between soundness (catching as many errors as possible) and completeness (not rejecting valid programs) that fundamentally impact the usability and usefulness of the type system.

In this talk, I'll examine a few of these tradeoffs that apply across many languages: type refinement and refinement invalidation, array out-of-bound errors, and variance (particularly array covariance). We'll look at what tradeoffs a gradual type system needs to make, what the advantages are to different approaches, and compare how various gradual type systems and more traditional static type systems handle these tradeoffs.

## Jordan Mechner - "How Prince of Persia Defeated Apple II's Memory Limitations" (War Stories, from Ars Technica)

For today’s episode of War Stories, Ars Technica sat down with Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner to learn about the challenges he faced while bringing his ambitious vision for the game to life. As the 1980's wound down, Mechner found himself fighting against not only the limitations of the Apple II hardware but the impending death of the platform itself. Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.

## Seth Coster - "Stress-Free Game Development: Powering Up Your Studio With DevOps" (2020 GDC)

Butterscotch Shenanigans' Seth Coster walks through how his team learned to use DevOps to get more done while working less. Even though it's game-development themed, many of the lessons apply to any software development project.

## Doc Norton - "The Technical Debt Trap" (NDC2014)

Technical Debt has become a catch-all phrase for any code that needs to be re-worked. Much like Refactoring has become a catch-all phrase for any activity that involves changing code. These fundamental misunderstandings and comfortable yet mis-applied metaphors have resulted in a plethora of poor decisions. What is technical debt? What is not technical debt? Why should we care? What is the cost of misunderstanding? What do we do about it? Doc discusses the origins of the metaphor, what it means today, and how we properly identify and manage technical debt.

## Kelsey Hightower - "From McDonald's to Google"

As a self taught engineer, Hightower honed his tech skills at the peak of the open source movement, which led to the democratization of software, and created pathways into tech for a new generation of aspiring computer professionals. In this session Hightower will explore his journey into tech and how he became one of the most respected people in cloud computing. Attendees will walk away from this session inspired by their own uniqueness and understand how to leverage technology to help shape the world they want to live in.

## Dr. Richard Cook - "Working at the Center of the Cyclone" (DevOps Enterprise Summit, 2018)

Ironically, our increasingly automated systems have increased the demand for thoughtful, skilled, and skeptical human experts capable of understanding them and intervening, often under intense pressure and high uncertainty. As the underlying technical entities increase in complexity and importance these pressures, uncertainty, and the stakes of expert decisions also increase. We’ve been studying what these people are doing and how they do it. Their results are exciting, encouraging, and worrisome. Exciting because the studies open a new window into how distributed systems are resilient. Encouraging because the expert work is so sophisticated and purposeful. Worrisome because it is clear that we are not yet building technologies that are team players and the path forward is not clear. What is clear is that understanding the cognitive work of experts is a powerful way of understanding the "system" and grounding our own understanding of where opportunities and vulnerabilities lie.
