## Rich Hickey - "The Value of Values" (keynote @ JaxConf 2012)

In this keynote speech from JaxConf 2012, Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure and founder of Datomic gives an awesome analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosphoical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data. The broad subject of the talk makes it worth watching for almost anyone in the programming world, and was one of the highlights of the JaxConf lineup.

## Maciej Cegłowski - "The Internet With A Human Face" (@ Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany, May 20, 2014)

A narrative that explains how the Internet of liberation became the Internet of inhuman and total surveillance. Increasingly, I'm heartened by the people who understand that the right debate to have is "How do we make the Internet a better place for human habitation?" and not "Is the Internet good or bad for us?" I'm also heartened to see the growth of the view that aggregated personal data is a kind of immortal toxic waste and that the best way to prevent spills is to not collect it in the first place.

## TJ Gokcen - "Kanban for Developers"

There is much hype about Kanban since it was perfected and introduced to the world by Toyota. Since then, not only manufacturers but all businesses looked into this simple but extremely powerful approach.

## Linus Torvalds - "On git" (Tech Talks @ Google 2007)

Linus Torvalds visits Google to share his thoughts on git, the source control management system he created two years ago.

## Jim Weirich and Joe O'Brien - "Mock Dialog" (Ruby Hoedown 2008)

Sit in like a fly on the wall with a development team as they wrestle with the issues of testing and the use of mock objects. Three acts cover using mock objects to remove dependencies on external dependencies, explore the use of mocks to isolate the code under test from the rest of the system, and look at when mocking can be an indication of a poor design. This is not your standard presentation with slides, but a peek into the everyday life of a development team.

## Josh Kaufman - "Shut Up and Take My Money: How to Find Business Ideas Customers Want" (MicroConf 2013)

A story on how to get to the ideal:

- Sit in front of customer
- tell them about your product
- get interrupted with “Shut up and take my money”

## Jack Diederich - "Stop Writing Classes" (PyCon 2012)

Classes are great but they are also overused. This talk will describe examples of class overuse taken from real world code and refactor the unnecessary classes, exceptions, and modules out of them.

## Idan Gazit - "Sketching a better product" (PyCon 2012)

If writing is a means for organizing your thoughts, then sketching is a means for organizing your thoughts visually. Just as good writing requires drafts, good design requires sketches: low-investment, low-resolution braindumps. Learn how

## Bret Victor - "Drawing Dynamic Visualizations"

Throughout the history of science, diagrams and graphs have been essential thinking tools. In the past, such visualizations were drawn with pen on paper, and could embrace the directness, freedom, and expressiveness of hand drawing. Most modern visualizations are programmed instead, where a single description can dynamically generate a unique picture for any dataset.
Today's tools offer the benefits of one or the other -- either directness or dynamics -- but not both. Photoshop and Illustrator allow direct-manipulation drawing of static pictures. D3, R, and Processing allow indirect-manipulation coding of dynamic pictures.
This talk presents a tool for drawing dynamic pictures -- creating data-driven visualizations, like D3, but via direct manipulation of the picture itself, like Illustrator.

## Bret Victor - "Inventing on Principle"

Bret Victor on the power and effectiveness of organizing your work around a guiding principle. Victor's principle is "creators need an immediate connection to what they create" and he shows some really cool ways he's exploring that idea.

## Bret Victor - "Learnable Programming"

Here's a trick question: How do we get people to understand programming?

## Bret Victor - "The Future of Programming"

Presented at Dropbox's DBX conference on July 9, 2013.

## Gary Bernhardt - "Fast Test, Slow Test"

Most unit tests aren't and their authors suffer for it. What is a unit test, really? How can writing them prevent classic testing problems? If you do write them, what trade-offs are you implicitly making?

## Raymond Hettinger - "The Art of Sublcassing"

All problems have simple, easy-to-understand, logical wrong answers. Subclassing in Python is no exception. Avoid the common pitfalls and learn everything you need to know about making effective use of inheritance in Python.

## David Cramer - "Practicing Continuous Deployment"

Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster, and more often.

## Steve Freeman - "Sustainable Test-Driven Development"

Steve Freeman offers advice on writing good tests that make development easier avoiding adding dead weight code that is hard to maintain. Freeman covers the following areas: test readability, complex test data, test diagnostics, and test flexibility.

## Martin Fowler - "Introduction to NoSQL" (GOTO Conferences)

Martin gives a rapid introduction to NoSQL databases: where they came from, the nature of the data models they use, and the different way you have to think about consistency. From this he outlines what kinds of circumstances you should consider using them, why they will not make relational databases obsolete, and the important consequence of polyglot persistence.

## Joshua Bloch - "How to Design A Good API and Why it Matters"

## Greg Wilson - "What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It's True"

Many claims are made about how certain tools, technologies, and practices improve software development. But which claims are verifiable, and which are merely wishful thinking?

## Kevin Lacker - "How to Design Great APIs" (Parse Developer Day 2013)

## Jake Archibald - "Reusable Code, for good or for awesome!" (beyond tellerrand Düsseldorf 2011)

What sets reusable JavaScript apart from other JavaScript? How can we make our code developer-friendly, fast, robust & compatible?

The API is make-or-break when it comes to reusable code. It's the API that lets other developers use your application, if it's difficult to use then they won't get the most out of what you've written.

We'll analyse existing APIs, looking at where they fail and where they succeed, looking at what patterns they use and how users react to them.

By looking at the wins and fails in the real world, we can discover what makes code a pleasure to use and reuse.

## Bertnard Meyer - "Genericity Versus Inheritance" (Paper)

Genericity, as in Ada or ML, and inheritance, as in object-oriented languages, are two alternative techniques for ensuring better extendibility, reusability, and compatibility of software components. This article is a comparative analysis of these two methods. It studies their similarities and differences and assesses to what extent each may be simulated in a language offering only the other. It shows what features are needed to successfully combine the two approaches in an object-oriented language that also features strong type checking. The discussion introduces the principal aspects of the language EiffePM whose design, resulting in part from this study, includes multiple inheritance and a limited form of genericity under full static typing.

## Bertnard Meyer - "Principles of language design and evolution"

Search for it, it's awesome
