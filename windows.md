# Using MS Windows

Not everything is Unixy this days, so sometimes is a good idea to have some tips for working under MS Windows

# Software

- [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net): A simple launcher that indexes the programs in the start menu and can launch documents, project files, folders and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes
- [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console):  a Windows console window enhancement. Console features include: multiple tabs, text editor-like text selection, different background types, alpha and color-key transparency, configurable font, different window styles [config guide](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Console2ABetterWindowsCommandPrompt.aspx)
- [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org) a lightweight and customizable music player. Specially awesome if you add [columns ui](http://yuo.be/columns.php) to it

# Common problems

## Can't launch IIS manager (or other software) from Launchy

This is related to x64 systems, and how some variables get replaced in Launcy. Just copy the exe to another location, and use a link to there [source](https://serverfault.com/questions/95495/the-great-vanishing-act-of-inetmgr-exe-on-my-windows-7-x64-system)
