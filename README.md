# My Recommendations

Apart from various ramblings you can find in this repo, here are some off-the bat recommendations

## Games

- [Monument Valley](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.monumentvalley): Rather short and not challenging at all, but both the music and graphics are awesome (having and Escherian inspiration is a plus)
- [Hitman GO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenixmontreal.hitmango): A lot of Hitman-style missions, in a turn-based strategy game. Having to play each level more than once to get all objectives is a bit boring, but I can live with that

## Apps
