Rather short and not challenging at all, but both the music and graphics are awesome (having and Escherian inspiration is a plus)
- [Hitman GO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenixmontreal.hitmango): A lot of Hitman-style missions, in a turn-based strategy game. Having to play each level more than once to get all objectives is a bit boring, but I can live with that. (There are Lara Croft and a Deus Ex versions of this game, with slightly different game mechanics)
